# lwm_anglophonechile

Part of the project for analysis using LLM:

- The notebook `QA_StarOfChile` contains the process involved in reading PDF publications and converting them into a knowledge base of data. This data is then transformed into an embedding database for local use. Users can query the data using the Question and Answer methods provided by [Langchain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/) and [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/product).
- The `Review_CSV` notebook is for processing the same data after it has undergone OCR analysis and segmentation.
